## Description

There is a simple scene in canvas with a grass field and a house. The screen is splited in 5 vertical sections and when you click on the specific section a clowd is getting created with a raindrop also start falling from the specific vertical coordinate that got clicked and starts falling on the ground (raining) until it reaches the very end and then starts again from the top of the canvas at the height of the cloud, falling in an an infinite loop.

More clicks are creating new drops. If the cloud is created on the activated section then it only creates new drops.

There is a "Stop the rain" button in order to reset the app that stop all the rain scene and removes the clouds.

Finally there is a "Storm" button as an option to make all the 5 sections activated with a storm cloud and put 30 random drops on the canvas in order to rain.
